## Introduction
Tomography, which is derived from the Greek word ‚Äútomos‚Äù that is ‚Äúslice‚Äù, denotes forming an image of an object from measurements made from slices or rays through it. In other words, forming the structure of an object based on a collection of slices through it.
In principle, it is usually an inverse problem where we have the data, we formulate the geometry of the ray paths and invert for the model parameters that defines the structure.

$$d = Gm$$

where, \\( d \\) is the vector containing the data, \\( m \\) is the vector containing the model
parameters and \\( G \\) is the kernel which maps the data into the model and vice-versa. If there are \\( N \\) number of data and \\( M \\) number of model parameters then the size of the matrix \\( G \\) is \\( N \times M \\).

The first step of this problem is to formulate a theoretical relationship between the data and model spaces and the underlying physics. Once, this theoretical relationship is established or the matrix \\( G \\) is formulated, we can address the above problem in two ways ‚Äì a forward problem or an inverse problem.

The forward problem can be taken as a trial and error process or as an exhaustive search through the model space for the best set of model parameters which can reduce the misfit between the observed and the predicted data. For this case, we guess the model based on the simple real world geology and then determine the data based on the theoretical relationship between data and models. In contrast, in the inverse problem we invert for the model parameters using the data and considering the theoretical relationship between the data and model parameters. Then we interpret for the real world geology.


The solution of the linear tomographic inverse problem depends on the relationship between \\( N \\) and \\( M \\). If \\( N \\) < \\( M \\), then we have more number of model parameters or variables to obtained and lesser number of data or equations to solve. In this case, the equation \\( d = Gm \\) does not provide enough information to determine uniquely all the model parameters and thus the problem is called underdetermined. We usually need extra constraints to solve this kind of problem, for example we take the a priori constraint that the solution to this problem is simple. If \\( N = M \\), then there is ideally enough information to determine the model parameters. But in real world, data is usually inaccurate and inconsistent to invert for the best model parameters in this case. If \\( N > M \\), there is too much information contained in the equation \\( d = Gm \\) for it to possess an exact solution. This case is called the overdetermined.

### Solution of the underdetermined linear inverse problem:
We take the a priori constraint that the solution is simple. The notion of simplicity is quantified by some measure of the length of the solution. One such measure is the Euclidean length of the solution, \\( L = m^{T}m \\).
